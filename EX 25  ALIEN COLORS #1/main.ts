// Question 25)
// Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
// • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

// • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

console.log("\n Answer 25\n");

let alien_color: string = 'pink';

// Passing version:
// Check if the alien's color is pink
if (alien_color == 'pink') {
    console.log("The player just earned 5 points.");
}

// Falling version:
let alien_color1: string = "blue";

// Check if the alien's color is pink
if (alien_color1 == 'pink') {
    console.log("The player just earned 5 points.");
}
