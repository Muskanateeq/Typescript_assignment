//  Question 12
// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

 console.log('\nAnswer 12\n')

 let names_info :string[] =["Shahzad","Aliyan","Shahzaib","Kashaf"];

const message:string ="I hope you are a great well:  ";
for(let i=0; i<names_info.length; i++){
    console.log(message + names_info[i]);

}
